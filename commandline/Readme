This commandline application for the Micronucleus bootloader is written by
ihsan Kehribar <ihsan@kehribar.me> and Bluebie <a@creativepony.com>

It's been tested casually on Mac, Windows, and Linux, and aught to work on all
three. To make and install, do the regular 'make; sudo make install' on unixes.
On windows just 'make' with mingw and do whatever people do with windows exes.

Usage on Ubuntu:
	sudo micronucleus --run name_of_the_file.hex
Usage on Mac:
  micronucleus --run name_of_the_file.hex
Usage on Windows
  micronucleus.exe --run name_of_the_file.hex

Raw binary file writing hasn't been tested much yet and is suspected to not
work.

Every now and then the program fails once it reaches the Writing stage - this is
a known bug - but if you simply rerun the micronucleus command immediately, it
will succeed the second time usually. Most of the time this issue is not present.
